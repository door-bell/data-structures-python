# Python Data Structures 
This repository contains my own implementation of different data structures in python. 

In the 'tests' folder, you can find tests for each of the data structures that I used to verify the validity of my implementations.

The tests are written using the `unittest` library, so to run them the same way you run any python script.

If you want to make a similar repository of your own, please feel free to use my test cases in your repository!
